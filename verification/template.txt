<cannary>I hereby freely say that I am not, and I never was, and I do not suspect to be in foreseeable future, under ANY form of NDA or gag order 
(nor ANY influence) that could in any way affect this verification testimony. (I am in law jurisdiction: <j>.........</j>).</cannary>

I, ...... (known from/related to project:  ......) can confirm, 
that I downloaded the source code with git sha1 sum as in line sources-sha1= above, and I built it 
on my system as described above, and that these sources did in fact produced the files with checksums as listed above in my-checksum= lines, 
and that the said build was done under following conditions:
* value of line my-computer-trust= means security of computer used by me for this: 0-50 is regular, 
  50-100 is hardened, 100-200 is +always airgap, 200-300 is +openhardware computer, best self-build
* value of my-code-review= means how I reviewed the primary source code 
  (the sources that have checksum sources-sha1=) as follows:
  0=no check; 2=glanced over the code; 4=reviewed by comparing to previously
  reviewed versions; 8=reviewed from scratch. 10=did deep review.
  (for all this values, the review applies to files as downloaded from git, with EXCLUSION of the grsecurity*patch file).
  WARNING: all extra code (e.g. downloaded by running this script) should be 
  checksummed on download by primary source code, otherwise the compilation
  outcome is not guaranteed to be meaningful.
* my-tools-sha1... list sha1sums (e.g. git name) of other sources that I build in order to build this code (e.g. the mempo-deb dpkg).
* as in my-grsecurity-sigchecked I did[/not] verified grsecurity*path files as correctly signed by the Spender's pubkey from http://grsecurity.net
